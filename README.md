**Reasons for this Repository**

This is my first time using GitHub, so I am still in the process of learning how to fully utilize all of its functions. You can expect my future writeups to be more organized and nicer to look at as well.

Cybersecurity always intrigued me because I viewed it as a career that was entirely reliant on puzzle solving. As someone who loves a challenge, I knew that obtaining a career in this field would hardly qualify as work due to how much I would enjoy it. However, I quickly became overwhelmed by the vast amount of information and resources necessary for cybersecurity. Even though I attended my SWIFT (Students With an Interest in the Future of Technology) club workshops and completed my school projects diligently, I quickly found out that I needed to immerse myself with more external resources if I truly wished to pursue this career.

To meet my goal of working in cybersecurity, I decided to use a GitHub repository to not only help me learn to navitgate the GitHub workflow, but to also document my progress in learning cybersecurity. These writeups will not only serve as a personal learning mechanism, but will also act as a motivator that pushes me to learn more about cybersecurity. I also hope that my documentation of a beginner's journey in cybersecurity can also serve as a source of inspiration for future cybersecurity enthusiasts.
