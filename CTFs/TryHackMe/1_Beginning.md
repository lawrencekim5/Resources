**TryHackMe | Beginnings**

In my club meetings in SWIFT, a constant reccomendation for members was that they immerse themselves in cybersecurity topics by competing in competitions. However, the the thought of competing in a competition with close to zero experience is extremely daunting. Fortunately, TryHackMe is a CTF site that offers different paths for different levels of experience. As a complete beginner, I was able to select the complete beginner path, and learn the fundamentals of hacking. Hopefully, with the experience that I gain from completing these challenges, I can build up my skills to the point where I can compete in competitions such as CCDC or CPTC.
